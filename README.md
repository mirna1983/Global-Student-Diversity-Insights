# Academic Diversity Analysis

## Installation Directions

1. **Download Datasets:**
   - Download the international-student-demographics datasets from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/international-student-demographics?select=academic.csv) 
   - Ensure you have the following datasets: `academic_detail_modified.csv`, `academic_modified.csv`, `field_of_study_modified.csv`, `origin_modified.csv`, `source_of_fund_modified.csv`, and `status_modified.csv`.

2. **Create Database:**
   - In your SQL environment, create a database named `Global_Student_Diversity_Insights`.

3. **Load Datasets:**
   - Load the datasets into the database tables with corresponding names:
     - `academic_detail_modified`
     - `academic_modified`
     - `field_of_study_modified`
     - `origin_modified`
     - `source_of_fund_modified`
     - `status_modified`

## Project Introduction

The goal of the "Global Student Diversity Insights" project is to analyze and understand trends related to student diversity on a global scale. The project encompasses various aspects, including academic details, field of study, origin, funding sources, and demographic information. The insights derived from this project aim to provide valuable information to educational institutions, policymakers, and researchers.


## Data Analysis

The data analysis process involves exploring, cleaning, and transforming the datasets. Refer to the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook for detailed steps.

## Hypothesis Testing

The hypothesis under investigation suggests a gradual increase in the representation of females in academic programs over the last decade. The `hypothesis_testing.ipynb` notebook details the methodologies used for testing this hypothesis.
